# AI-Financial-Agent

A **personal project** exploring the design of a financial AI agent that analyzes market data and company fundamentals, then communicates insights using **ElevenLabs voice AI**. Built for explainable analysis, reporting, and automation rather than predictive trading.

## Overview

AI-Financial-Agent is a personal project focused on building an **analysis-first AI system** that turns structured financial data into clear, human-understandable insights. Instead of making predictions or executing trades, the agent emphasizes reasoning, transparency, and communication.
